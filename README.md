# API Exercise

Here's the solution for the suggested exercise using Rails 5 to build a tiny API.

The main difference between this solution and the description provided is that I'm modeling `GroupEvent` here intended to be a `Group` with many events on it and an additional User entity was introduced to reflect what I think that should be something more close to a tiny but useful first version.

Here's how the models relationship looks like:

```bash
==============           ==============           ==============
|            |           |            |           |            |
|    User    |  1 => N   | GroupEvent |  1 => N   |    Event   |
|            |           |            |           |            |
==============           ==============           ==============
```

Additionally, instead of Rspec the tests was intentionally written using the Minitest (included by default on Rails 5) and all test can be found in the /test folder.

Questions or feedbacks about this solution are very welcome at any time.
