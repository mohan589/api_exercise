# Whitespectre Exercise

Here's the solution for the suggested exercise.

The main difference between this solution and the description provided is that I'm modeling `GroupEvent` here intended to be a `Group` with many events on it. On the description, GroupEvent seems like the Event itself and looks like the single entity to be delivered.

Also, was introduced an additional User entity just to reflect what I think that should be something more close to a tiny but useful first version.

Here's how the models relationship looks like:

==============           ==============           ==============
|            |           |            |           |            |
|    User    |  1 => N   | GroupEvent |  1 => N   |    Event   |
|            |           |            |           |            |
==============           ==============           ==============

Additionally, instead of Rspec the tests was written using the Minitest (included by default on Rails 5) and all test can be found in the /test folder.

Questions or feedbacks about this solution are very welcome at any time.

Tailor.
