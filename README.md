## Examples to start using the API

#### Creating a new User
```bash
  curl -d "user[name]=Tailor"  http://localhost:3000/users
```

#### Creating a Group Event
```bash
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d ' {"group_event":{"title":"Canada Trip","days_duration":"20", "user_id":"1"}}' http://localhost:3000/group_events
```

#### Listing all Group Events
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/group_events
```

#### Creating a Event
```bash
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d ' {"event":{"name":"Passport","description":"renew the passport", "location":"SÃ£o Paulo", "start_date":"10-10-2016", "end_date":"12-10-2016", "group_event_id": "1"}}' http://localhost:3000/events
```

TODO:
- [ ] Tests on Event Params service.
- [ ] Add more examples on README to use the API
- [ ] Add a better description about the solution on README.
- [ ] Provide some seeders data on `seed.rb` file

Deliverable:
Write an AR model, spec and migration for a GroupEvent that would meet the needs of the description above. Then write the api controller and spec to support JSON request/responses to manage these GroupEvents. For the purposes of this exercise, ignore auth. Please provide your solution as a rails app called exercise_YYMMDD_yourname, sent as a zip file.
